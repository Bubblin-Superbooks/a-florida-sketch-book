I was ready to christen the road anew,—Redbird Road.</p><p>But the redbirds, many and conspicuous as they were, had no monopoly of the road or of the day. House wrens were equally  numerous and equally at home, though they sang more out of sight. Red-eyed chewinks, still far from their native berry pastures, hopped into a bush to cry, “Who’s he?” at the passing of a stranger, in whom, for aught I know, they may have half recognized an old acquaintance. A bunch of quails ran across the road a little in front of me, and in another place fifteen or twenty red-winged blackbirds (not a red wing among them) sat gossiping in a treetop. Elsewhere, even later than this (it was now April 7), I saw flocks, every bird of which wore shoulder-straps,—like the traditional militia company, all officers. <em>They</em> did not gossip, of course (it is the male that sports the red), but they made a lively noise.</p></div> </div>
