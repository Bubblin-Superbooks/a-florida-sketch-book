Boggy places were full of blue iris (the common <em>Iris versicolor</em> of New England, but of ranker growth), and here and there a pool was yellow with bladderwort. I was taken also with the larger and taller (yellow) butterwort, which I used never to see as I went through the woods in the morning, but was sure to find standing in the tall dry grass along the border of the sandy road, here one and  there one, on my return at noon. In similar places grew a “yellow daisy” (<em>Leptopoda</em>), a single big head, of a deep color, at the top of a leafless stem. It seemed to be one of the most abundant of Florida spring flowers, but I could not learn that it went by any distinctive vernacular name.</p></div> </div>
